					<h2>Inbound</h2>
          <p>DC1 Inbound is different from other buildings in that it is a "Team Productivity" measurement.  This means that for each job function, the total number of cases/units for a shift will be divided amongst the associates based on the percent of hours spent in that job function.  For example, 2 associates receive 100 cases with associate A spending 20 minutes receiving and associate B spent 30 minutes receiving (50 total minutes), associate A will get credit for 40% of the units (20min/50min) or 40 cases/units.  Associate B would receive credit for 60 cases/units.  We would then use standard UPH calculations to assign a performance percent as we do with other UPH functions.  You will often times see associates with the same productivity scores if the spent the same amount of time in the function (working as a team).</p>

          <h3>Receiving - GOH</h3>
          <p> Receiving GOH merchandise (Garment On Hanger) is a function that currently takes place in DC3 upper.  There is currently no productivity standard associated with this function as it does not accumulate enough hours ni operation and it would require separate GOH shipments created by DC3.  As it stands, DC3 is able to use the same PkMS shipments created by the DC1 Vendor Coordination Team for the receipt of this merchandise.

          <h3>PTL - Consolidated</h3>
          <p>Put To Light (PTL) Consolidated is an "LM-style" (Labor Managment-style) form of productivity collection.  We determine this by assigning each department an allotted time, in seconds, to be processed by an associate.  The total time that the associate is allotted is calculated by adding the seconds for each department for each day.  Kronos data is used to determine the total time that the associate actually spent processing.  Performance is (allotted time/actual time).</p>
          <p>It is important to monitor spikes in each department (positive or negative) as this could impact associate productivity scores dramatically.  A report is sent out on Monday each week by MGLReporting@lb.com that will outline this information for you.  If you are not receiving this email, please reach out to MGLReporting@lb.com and request to be added.</p>
          <p>The goal of this "LM-style" collection process was to minimize cross-punching for different departments and make a more fair rating system for associates.</p>

          <div class="articleRight">
            <div class="articleRightInner">
              <img src="images/UPHEditor.PNG" alt="pencil" style="width:500px;height:300px;" />
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>UPH expectations for associates are to be entered every month by leaders.  The form can be found in DM Portal under 006 - Review - UPH Monthly.</p>
          <p>This allows leaders to respond to business trends (merchandise mix, seasonality, etc.) and adjust expectations accordingly.</p>
          <p>You are able to enter the UPH expectation directly into the form by typing the numerical value into the corresponding box for the month/function.</p>
          <p><strong>An important limitation of this form is that a leader <u>cannot</u> change a UPH vlaue for a month that has already passed.</strong></p>
          <p>This is done under the assumption that associate reviews are given during a certain timeframe and we would not want the data to change on a review that has theoretically been given to an associate.</p>
          <p>Should you need to change the value of a month that has already been completed, please email MGLData@lb.com and CC your immediate manager along with your HR Partner to receive the required approvals.</p>

          <h3>Tiering</h3>
          <a name="Tier"></a>
          <div class="articleRight">
            <div class="articleRightInner">
              <img src="images/Tiering.PNG" alt="pencil" style="width:500px;height:300px;" />
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Associate Tiering was created to allow leaders to tier associate expectations (individually or as a group of associates) by job function/s.  This  is typically done for new hires and/or associate's who have not performed a job function  for a long period of time/never performed said job function.  Tier levels are designated, in order from lowest tier to highest tier, 'L1', 'L2', 'L3', and 'Reg'.  Reg is the default (100% of expectation) level and does not need entered.  Tiering will essentially allow an associate more time to complete tasks.</p>
          <p>You can find this form in DM Portal under 006 - Reviews - Associate Tiering.</p>
          <p>You are able to filter the list of associates on the left side of the form by selecting a leader from the 'Reports To' drop-down along the top of the form.</p>
          <p>Any associate selected in the list on the left side will be added into the 'Selected Associates' box.</p>
          <p>You will want to select a 'Brand' and 'Department' in order to populate the job functions in the 'Please choose tasks' box on the right side of the form.</p>
          <p>Once all of these parameters have been entered, you will want to select the start date for the tiering to take place (DM Portal will automatically add the end date 30 days from the start date).</p>
          <p>DM Portal will also automatically add the remaining tier levels to the associate in an effort to ensure the leader does not need to revisit the form for the associate/s.  <strong>For example, if you add an associate at L1 starting on 5/13/2020, DM Portal will add the end date and will also add start and end dates for L2 and L3 based on the 30 day allotment for each level.</strong></p>
          <p><b>An important limitation of this form is that a leader can only tier an associate/s 5 days prior to the current date and infinitely into the future.</b></p>
          <p>This was done to ensure data is not changing after an associate has already viewed it.</p>
          <p>Should you need to add or change the value/s of a tier for a date that has already passed the acceptable date range, please email MGLData@lb.com and CC your immediate manager along with your HR Partner to receive the required approvals.</p>

            <p>2. Shows the UPH/LM goal.  The default value for this is 10,000 (the intent is to alert leaders through low productivity numbers that a UPH/LM adjustment needs made in <a href="#">UPH Monthly</a> Form).</P>
            <p>3. Shows the Kronos ID of the associate.  A version of the report that has the name of the associate is available; however, we do not recommend posting any report with an associate's name. </P>
            <p>4. Shows the WTD performance of the job function in box 1.</P>
            <p>5. Shows the WTD performance for all functions performed by an associate.</P>
