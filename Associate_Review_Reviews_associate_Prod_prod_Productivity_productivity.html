        <p>DM Portal <strong>Associate Reviews</strong>, come in three different variations (Individual Contributor,
          Processor, and Lead), and provide the basis for merit increase at the end of each fiscal year. Reviews are
          delivered bi-monthly (every other month) with the first yearly review taking place in April for the months of
          February and March. A schedule for all review-related activities can be found on the <a

        <p>This is the form located within DM Portal at 006-Review > Associate Reviews (edit), and will be used to view,
          modify, and print Associate Reviews by leaders.</p>
        <p>As this data is very sensitive, a Portal User must be granted access to review data by the Morse Road Data
          Management Team. <strong>Should you encounter an issue where no data is populating in the form, you are likely
            not on the list of users given access</strong> An email to MGLData@lb.com will fix this issue.</p>
        <p><strong>Associate Review override scenarios</strong> arrise when a modification is required for a review
          after the review delivery period (1st week after the fiscal month ends). We require that any issue/request
          includes the associate's Manager and HR Partner. The additional approval process was implemented to create
          more conversation around a review that could have already been delivered to an associate. Our goal is to never
          change a review value after a review period is completed, but exceptions do arrise (ex. a poor day of
          productivity not toggled off, errant accuracy data, safety point updates, attendance point updates, procedural
          error updates, etc.)</p>

              <div>
                <p> The intent of the Tiering Form is to allow DC leaders to allot associates more time to complete
                  tasks (ex. New hires, cross-training, associates who do not perform job function often, return from
                  LOA, etc.). </P>
                <p> A tier can be assigned from the 5 days prior to the current date and infinitely into the future.
                </P>
                <p>Tier levels are determined by building leadership and can be different between buildings. </P>
                <p> L1 - 30 days (date range will be automatically determined once a start date is entered) </P>
                <p><strong> Portal will automatically add L2, L3, and Reg after you have entered the L1 tier.</strong>

                <p>L2 - 30 days (date range will be automatically determined once a start date is entered) </P>
                <p><strong> If you skip L1, Portal will automatically add L3 and Reg after you have entered the L2
                    tier.</strong> </P>
                <p>L3 - 30 days (date range will be automatically determined once a start date is entered) </P>
                <p><strong> If you skip L2, Portal will automatically add Reg after you have entered the L3
                    tier.</strong> </P>
                <p>Reg - the default expectation level for any associate not on a tier program. </P>
                <p><i>Associates can be tiered individually or as a group of associates by selecting the desired
                    associates from the associate list on the left side of the form.</i> </P>
                <p>Once you have selected your desired associate/s, you will select a start date (end date will be
                  automatically calculated and not able to be edited). </P>
                <p>A job function or group of job functions can then be selected in the column at the far right of the

                  <p>The default value for every function is 10,000 with the intent being a group of associates

                          DC3 Upper). At the beginning of each month a UPH standard (Portal 006-Review > UPH Monthly) is
                          set by the leadership team according to the Traffic Light reporitng for the previous month
                          which will outline your trending UPH for a given function for a given review period. An
                          associate processing units in a given function will be cross-punched into a corresponding
                          Kronos code that will allow the data team to capture the 'actual' amount of time an associate
                          spent in the aforementioned function.</p>
