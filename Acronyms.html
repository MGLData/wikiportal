The purpose of an ASN is to notify the customer when shipping occurs and provide physical characteristics about the shipment so the customer can be prepared to accept delivery.</p>
          <p><u>ASRS</u>-<strong>Automated Storage & Retrieval System</strong>-a material handling sysytem implemented in DC2 and DC6 that brings finished goods to an associate from reserve automatically instead of an associate traveling to the finished goods eliminating the need for excess travel and replenishment labor.</p>

          <p><u>BBW</u>-<strong>Bath & Body Works</strong>-an American retailer under the L Brands (formerly Limited Brands) umbrella, along with Victoria's Secret.

          <p><u>BOL</u>-<strong>Bill of Lading</strong>-is a document issued by a carrier (or their agent) to acknowledge receipt of cargo for shipment. Although the term historically related only to carriage by sea, a bill of lading may today be used for any type of carriage of goods. A comprehensive article on Bill of Lading Bills of lading are one of three crucial documents used in international trade to ensure that exporters receive payment and importers receive the merchandise. The other two documents are a policy of insurance and an invoice. Whereas a bill of lading is negotiable, both a policy and an invoice are assignable. In international trade outside the United States, bills of lading are distinct from waybills in that the latter are not transferable and do not confer title. Nevertheless, the UK Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 grants "all rights of suit under the contract of carriage" to the lawful holder of a bill of lading, or to the consignee under a sea waybill or a ship's delivery order.

<p>A bill of lading must be transferable, and serves three main functions:</p>

<p>-it is a conclusive receipt, i.e. an acknowledgement that the goods have been loaded; and</p>
<p>-it contains or evidences the terms of the contract of carriage; and</p>
<p>-it serves as a document of title to the goods, subject to the nemo dat rule</p></p>
