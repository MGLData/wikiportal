        <h2>LM/PE Overview</h2>
        <a name="Background"></a>
        <h3>LM Background</h3>
        <p>Labor Management (LM or PE) is a web-based application developed by Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The application uses engineered time studies and an X, Y, Z facility layout to determine the amount of time a
          task should take to complete. The X, Y, Z layout is primarily used to determine travel time between locations
          while the time studies determine the amount of time each idividual movement should take an average associate
          working at an average speed (ex. bending down, grabbing a label, packing a large unit, packing a small unit,
          etc.). The system will also track the actual time that the associate required to complete the task and
          translate that into a performance percent (Allotted Time/Actual Time).</p>
        <a name="LM"></a>

          <li>SB2 & SB2 - LM 2018</li>
          <a name="Terms"></a>
          <h3>Terminology</h3>
          <p>Below are some of the most commonly used terms associates with LM/PE.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>PE</b> - Percent Effiective - This is the calculation mentioned above (Allotted Time/Actual Time).
            </li>
            <li><b>SAMs</b> - Standard Allowable Minutes - This is the amount of time allotted to an associate to
              complete a task/s. This value is determined by the engineered time studies completed by the engineering
              team.</li>
            <li><b>OSDL</b> - On-Standard Direct Labor - This is the amount of time is actually took and associate to
              complete a task/s.</li>
            <li><b>UIL</b> - Unapproved Indirect Labor - This is any time that the LM system cannot account for, also
              referred to as 'Gap Time'. This time will negatively impact a PE score unless the value is a negative
              number; in which case, means the associate had two or more events overlap. This overlap could be the
              result of incorrectly kiosking into a function prior to the completion of the previous task, working
              during a scheduled break (lunch or breaks) as LM requires an assigned break time to ensure that time does
              not negatively impact an associate, or a few other less common scenarios.</li>
            <li><b>NSDL</b> - </li>
            <li><b>UDIL</b> - </li>
            <li><b>OSIL</b> - </li>
            <li><b>Adj OSDL</b> - </li>
            <li><b>PAID BREAK</b> - </li>
            <li><b>UNPAID BREAK</b> - </li>
            <li><b>PE</b> - </li>
            <li><b>UTIL</b> - </li>
            <li><b>EFF</b> - </li>

          <h2>LM Access</h2>
          <p>If you are a leader who requires access to the LM application for your building, please reach out to the
            'Super User' for your specific building. As these individuals will change from time to time, we will not
            list anyone in this article, but your immediate leader will be able to point you in the right direction.</p>
          <a name="FAQs"></a>
          <h3>LM Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
          <p>Below are some of the frequently asked questions in regards to Labor Management:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How does LM know the difference between a single-deep and double-deep location?</li>
            <li><b>-LM utilizes X,Y,Z coordinates to map a warehouse (aisles, locations, time clocks, etc.). If the
                double-deep location only has one PkMS designation, LM will map the X,Y,Z to the middle of the
                double-deep location to give an average amount of time it would take to pull a pallet from the racking.
                If the double-deep has two locations in PkMS, then each location will have an X,Y,Z.</b></li>
            <li>How do I get access to LM?</li>
            <li><b>-Access to LM must be granted by a system admin/superuser. Each building will have this person
                designated by leadership. If you are unsure who your admin/superuser is, please reach out to your
                immediate leader.</b></li>
            <li>Why doesn't LM match DM Portal?</li>
            <li><b>-LM calculates an associate's daily performance using all available job functions and tracked time.
                DM Portal only takes into account OSDL (On-standard or productive) job functions. For example, and
                associate could accrue UIL (Gap time) while they were in a CLEANING job function. In LM this would
                negatively impact the associate as the UIL would be calculated into the overall daily performance while
                DM Portal ignores time spent in off-standard (and job function without a productivity standard). In this
                example the associate's performance would be higher in DM Portal than in LM (this is the most common
                scenario). There are times when the aforementioned example will result in an overlap in LM (negative
                UIL). DM Portal will ignore the negative UIL just the same as positive UIL, meaning the performance in
                DM Portal would be slightly less than the performance showing in LM (less common example). The idea is
                to benefit the associate in these situations and not penalize someone for not using a kiosk
                correctly.</b></li>
            <li></li>
          </ul>
          <a name="System"></a>
          <h2>System Details</h2>
          <p>LM is designed to be used <b>only</b> on the Google Chrome platform. Running on Internet Explorer or
            Firefox could result in unexpected website behavior.</p>
          <a name="Interface"></a>
          <h3>System Interface</h3>
          <p> The LM interface can be somewhat intimidating at first. Below we will show you how to navigate to some of
            the more commonly used screens for DC Leaders.</p>
          <p>.</p>
          <a name="JF"></a>
          <h3>Job Functions</h3>
          <p>LM is broken down into job functions (made up of individual activities). For example, LTFCPICKING would be
            less than full case picking (mod picking) in DC7. This is made up of over 20 smaller activities. Each
            activity was developed through numerous time studies by Mast engineering. Each movement that is part of of
            job function is measured to ensure the associate is assessed a fair performance score.</p>
          <a name="Perf"></a>
          <h3>Daily Performance Monitoring</h3>
          <p>LM is extremely useful in monitoring real-time performance. Below are two screens that will assist leaders
            in assessing the performance of their area in real-time.</p>

          <h3>Kiosks</h3>
          <p>LM kiosks are used by associates to switch between on-standard job functions and job functions that do not
            count toward their daily productivity calculations.</p>
          <p>For example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>-An associate performing a picking job function needs to perform a cleaning function.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The associate would locate the nearest kiosk and use the LM interface (automatically on the correct
                screen) to switch to the cleaning job function.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <p>It is imperitive that assoiates perform these operations in a timely manner to avoid any significant impact
            to their daily productivity.</p>
          <p>Some DCs have the ability to use an indirect menu in the RF unit in leu of physical kiosks (DC 8 namely).

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>UPH expectations for associates are to be entered every month by leaders. The form can be found in DM
            Portal under 006 - Review - UPH Monthly.</p>
          <p>This allows leaders to respond to business trends (merchandise mix, seasonality, etc.) and adjust
            expectations accordingly.</p>
          <p>You are able to enter the UPH expectation directly into the form by typing the numerical value into the
            corresponding box for the month/function.</p>
          <p><strong>An important limitation of this form is that a leader <u>cannot</u> change a UPH vlaue for a month
              that has already passed.</strong></p>
          <p>This is done under the assumption that associate reviews are given during a certain timeframe and we would
            not want the data to change on a review that has theoretically been given to an associate.</p>
          <p>Should you need to change the value of a month that has already been completed, please email MGLData@lb.com
            and CC your immediate manager along with your HR Partner to receive the required approvals.</p>

          <p>Associate Tiering was created to allow leaders to tier associate expectations (individually or as a group
            of associates) by job function/s. This is typically done for new hires and/or associate's who have not
            performed a job function for a long period of time/never performed said job function. Tier levels are
            designated, in order from lowest tier to highest tier, 'L1', 'L2', 'L3', and 'Reg'. Reg is the default (100%
            of expectation) level and does not need entered. Tiering will essentially allow an associate more time to
            complete tasks.</p>
          <p>You can find this form in DM Portal under 006 - Reviews - Associate Tiering.</p>
          <p>You are able to filter the list of associates on the left side of the form by selecting a leader from the
            'Reports To' drop-down along the top of the form.</p>
          <p>Any associate selected in the list on the left side will be added into the 'Selected Associates' box.</p>
          <p>You will want to select a 'Brand' and 'Department' in order to populate the job functions in the 'Please
            choose tasks' box on the right side of the form.</p>
          <p>Once all of these parameters have been entered, you will want to select the start date for the tiering to
            take place (DM Portal will automatically add the end date 30 days from the start date).</p>
          <p>DM Portal will also automatically add the remaining tier levels to the associate in an effort to ensure the
            leader does not need to revisit the form for the associate/s. <strong>For example, if you add an associate
              at L1 starting on 5/13/2020, DM Portal will add the end date and will also add start and end dates for L2
              and L3 based on the 30 day allotment for each level.</strong></p>
          <p><b>An important limitation of this form is that a leader can only tier an associate/s 5 days prior to the
              current date and infinitely into the future.</b></p>
          <p>This was done to ensure data is not changing after an associate has already viewed it.</p>
          <p>Should you need to add or change the value/s of a tier for a date that has already passed the acceptable
            date range, please email MGLData@lb.com and CC your immediate manager along with your HR Partner to receive
            the required approvals.</p>
